# If benderUncertaintyType is PathDependent then benderUncertaintyModel is
# ignored. If benderUncertaintyType is DistanceDependent and the
# benderUncertaintyDirectory is a salsa3d model directory then a
# benderUncertaintyModel is ignored because the salsa3d directory
# will contain distance dependent uncertainty information for only one model.

# benderUncertaintyModel must be specified and must point to a
# directory that contains valid travel time uncertainty information.

# when benderUncertaintyType = PathDependent, you must specify a directory that
# PCalc can write lots of temporary files to when computing path dependent
# uncertainty. The directory will be created if it does not exist but will not
# be deleted at the end of the run. Information written in the directory will
# be deleted at the end of the run but may get left if the run
# fails. Feel free to delete or empty this directory anytime that PCalc is not
# using it. Ignored for DistanceDependent uncertainty

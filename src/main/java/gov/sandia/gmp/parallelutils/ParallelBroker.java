/**
 * The base class ParallelBroker object used to handle parallel task
 * submissions in an arbitrary manner. Five different parallel modes are
 * supported including: "sequential", "concurrent", "distributed",
 * "distributed_cuda_sp", and "distributed_cuda_dp". The "sequential" mode is
 * used for debugging purposes only or in rare cases where only one machine
 * with one processor is available for processing. The concurrent mode is used
 * to take advantage of several processors on a single machine. The last three
 * use the Java Parallel Processing Framework (JPPF) to handle many separate
 * nodes (processors) on many distributed machines. A static factory method
 * (create) is defined that allows a user to access any of the above brokers.
 * 
 * <P> Several functions are defined to allow the user to submit tasks, get
 * results, and check on the relative state of the broker (size, empty,
 * processor count, broker type, etc.). All submitted tasks must use the
 * interface ParallelTask. All returned results must use the interface
 * ParallelResults. Tasks must be implemented by the user to perform the
 * specific requirements of the application. Results must be defined to
 * contain the relevant results from each task for return to the application.
 * 
 * <p> Nine primary functions are supported including:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> public abstract void submit(List<? extends ParallelTask> tsks); </li>
 * <li> public abstract void submit(ParallelTask tsk); </li>
 * <li> public abstract List<ParallelResult> getResults(); </li>
 * <li> public abstract List<ParallelResult> getResultsWait(); </li>
 * <li> public abstract ParallelResult getResult(); </li>
 * <li> public abstract ParallelResult getResultWait(); </li>
 * <li> public abstract int size(); </li>
 * <li> public abstract boolean isEmpty(); </li>
 * <li> public abstract void close(); </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p> The two submit functions submit an array of tasks or a single entry
 * for processing using one of the modes above. These functions are non-
 * blocking and return immediately.
 * 
 * <p> There are four result retrieval functions getResult() and
 * getResultWait() return a single result submitted by one of the first
 * two functions or null if no results are available. The returned result is
 * not necessarily in the order that it was submitted. The functions
 * getResults() and getResultsWait() return all currently available results.
 * 
 * <p> The "Wait" version will block and wait for a result if any are
 * pending. The non "Wait" version return null immediately if no results are
 * available. All four functions return null immediately if their are no
 * available results and none pending.
 * 
 * <p> The function size returns the number of results that are or will be
 * available once all results from the submit functions have been processed.
 * The function isEmpty() returns true if no results remain (none are
 * available and none are pending).
 * 
 * <p> The function close cleans up resources used by the CONCURRENT and
 * DISTRIBUTED modes. It performs no action for the SEQUENTIAL mode.

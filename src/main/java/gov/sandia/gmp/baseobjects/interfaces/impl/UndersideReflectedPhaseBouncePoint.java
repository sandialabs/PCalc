/**
 * Used by predictors that understand under-side reflection bounce points. The
 * class sets the state of a "bounce point" position to be either "Fixed" or
 * "Variable". The default is variable, in which case the predictor determines
 * the bounce point position using optimization to minimize the total ray travel
 * time. If the state is set to "Fixed" then predictor simply calculates the ray
 * using the fixed position and returns the result. The position used can be
 * determined by the predictor or passed in by the PredictionRequest. If the
 * PredictionRequest is set up containing a fixed bounce point position then
 * that position is used to calculate the ray. Otherwise, the predictor will
 * attempt to evaluate a static position using it's AK135 TauP bounce point
 * files. If a TauP bounce point file does not exist for the phase then the
 * predictor will throw an erro.

/**
 * An ObservationsPhaseSiteMap container that is used to subdivide prediction
 * results into a series of sets so as not to overload RayUncertaintyTask
 * objects during the ray uncertainty calculation. This object defines the set
 * as locked once the number of ray weight elements added to this set exceeds
 * the static parameter aElementLimit. At that point the set allows no new
 * phase / site pairs to be added to this set; instead they are added to a new
 * set created by RayWeightSetList. This set can still add rays, once it becomes
 * locked however, but the rays must belong to one of the phase / site pairs
 * already contained by this set. Once all rays have been added to the set for
 * those defined phase / site pairs the ray weights are written to disk for
 * each matrix block row.
 * <p>
 * This object contains ObservationsSourceMap objects that are pulled directly
 * from the static ObservationsPhaseSiteMap aPrimeRayWghtMap. This object was
 * set by RayUncertainty before the ray uncertainty calculation is begun.
 * Effectively, the RayWeightSetList object, owned by the RayUncertainty object,
 * subdivides aPrimeRayWghtMap into several RayWeightSet objects that contain
 * a subset of entries from aPrimeRayWghtMap, such that no entry has many more
 * ray weight elements than the other.

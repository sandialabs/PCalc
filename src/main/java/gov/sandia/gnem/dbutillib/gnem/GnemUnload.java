/**
 * The GnemUnload class does some special "GNEM specific" processing of rows
 * in a RowGraph before those rows are deleted/unloaded from the database.
 * This "special processing" applies entirely to rows from event tables.
 * Event tables are an odd case since they serve in a sort of collection
 * capacity.  One event groups together a Collection of origin rows, with
 * one of those origin rows being the preferred origin for the event.
 * <p>
 * There are three different scenarios for how events and some or all of their
 * origins can get added to a RowGraph:
 * 1 - All origins associated with an event are present in the RowGraph.
 * In this case, the event and all of the origins can be deleted.
 * This case is handled by {@link Unload#deleteRows Unload.deleteRows()}
 * 2 - The preferred origin associated with an event is not present in the
 * RowGraph.
 * In this case, the event cannot be deleted.  However, its prefor that
 * points to the preferred origin does not need to be changed since the
 * preferred origin is not in the RowGraph of things to delete.
 * This case is handled by {@link Unload#deleteRows Unload.deleteRows()}
 * 3 - The preferred origin associated with an event is present in the RowGraph.
 * This is the case that requires special handling.  The event cannot be
 * deleted because there are other origins associated with it that are not
 * part of the RowGraph (if those origins were part of the RowGraph, then we
 * would be dealing with the first case mentioned above).  However, since the
 * event's prefor is being deleted, then the event needs a new preferred
 * origin chosen from the origins that are outside of the RowGraph.  The
 * author ranking table indicates how to chose among several of such origins
 * based on author priorities.
 * <p>
 * Since the first two cases are covered by the generic
 * {@link Unload#deleteRows deleteRows} method in Unload, GnemUnload only
 * needs to handle the third case in its own deleteRows method.

/**
 * <p>
 * This class implements functionality to merge rows from a set of source tables that are part of a source schema, into
 * a set of corresponding target tables that are part of a target schema.
 * <p>
 * During a merge: <br>
 * a) All foreign keys are remapped to ensure that primary key constraints are not violated in the target tables. New ID
 * values are obtained from an IDGaps table associated with the target schema. (If the IDGaps table is set to null, then
 * no merge will take place and data from the source will simply be inserted into the target.) <br>
 * b) Information is added to the target schema's Remap table which remaps the old value of an ID (the value in the
 * source table) to its new value (the value in the target table). <br>
 * c) Source rows are set to either have copies inserted into the target, to have their data update target data, or to
 * be ignored and not represented in the target in any way (typically because their data is already in the target). Rows
 * are copied from the source tables to the target tables only if the unique key information contained in the source row
 * does not already exist in the target tables.
 * <p>
 * See {@link #mergeRows mergeRows} method for more information on how the actual merge is performed or
 * {@link #execute(RowGraph, MergeStatistics, boolean, RemapTable, IDGapsTable, UndoSqlTable, boolean) execute} for a
 * method that calls {@link #mergeRows mergeRows} and then inserts or updates the rows in the target schema.
 * <p>
 * <i>Note: If the user wishes to simply insert data, not merge it, into the target schema, this can be accomplished by
 * setting the idgaps table in the target schema to null and calling
 * {@link #execute(RowGraph, MergeStatistics, boolean, RemapTable, IDGapsTable, UndoSqlTable, boolean) execute} . In so
 * doing, {@link #mergeRows mergeRows} will not be called.</i>
 * <p>
 * The class requires the following 3 pieces of information:
 * <p>
 * 1) The source {@link Schema schema}.
 * <p>
 * 2) The target {@link Schema schema}.
 * <p>
 * 3) An optional Set<{@link Table Tables}> that includes Table objects from the source schema for which there is no
 * corresponding Table of the same type in target schema. This class assumes the reader is familiar with {@link Schema
 * Schema}, {@link RowGraph RowGraph}, and {@link Row Row} objects. In order to get a decent understanding of what this
 * class's purpose is, it's best to peruse and understand the {@link #mergeRows mergeRows} method.

     * This method traverses the entire RowGraph four times.

     * 1st traversal: Visit all the idowner table rows. Add appropriate RemapTable information to the local remap table.
     * Set the row's status variable.
     * <p>
     * 2nd traversal: At this point, all source rows from idOwner tables have been examined and remap information for
     * their owned ids has been added to the remap table. No actual id values have been changed yet. Source rows from
     * non-idOwner tables are now considered. <br>
     * The target is NOT examined to see if it contains rows equal to source non-idowner rows if <br>
     * a) all of the idowner rows were merged <br>
     * b) all of the idowner rows from tables that the non-idowner row refers to were merged
     * <p>
     * 3rd traversal: Iterate through all of the rows to ensure that every rows' status is set. If the status is not
     * set, throw an exception. <br>
     * If the row's status is DBDefines.INSERT (this row is to be added to the target schema), then the remapTable will
     * be used to remap the IDs. If remapping is unsuccessful, (perhaps the row contains foreign key values that do not
     * have entries in the remap table), an error is generated. 4th traversal: Accumulate statistics
     *
     * @param rowGraph        the collection of related source rows to transform into Row objects that are members of the

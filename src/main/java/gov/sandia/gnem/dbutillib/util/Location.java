/**
 * <p>Title: Location</p>
 *
 * <p>Description: </p>
 * The Location Class manages a single point in/on the Earth.  Both spherical and
 * ellipsoidal earth can be supported, depending on the values assigned to
 * static constant values EARTH_A and EARTH_F.
 *
 * <p>Points in the earth are represented internally by a geocentric,
 * 3 component unit vector that has its origin at the center of the earth. The
 * x-component points to lon,lat = 0,0.  y-component points to lon,lat =
 * PI/2,0 and the z-component points to lon,lat = 0,PI/2.  The radius of point
 * (the distance in km from the center of the earth to the point) is also stored.
 *
 * <p>There are constructors that take geographic latitudes and longitudes as parameters
 * and convert them to geocentric unit vectors.  There are many methods for
 * computing the distance between 2 Location objects, the azimuth from one Location
 * to another, the Location that is normal to the plane containing the great circle
 * path from one Location to another, the radius of the earth at a given location, etc.
 * There is a method for rotating a Location some angular distance around another
 * Location.
 *
 * <p>If the value of EARTH_F is > 0 then geographic latitudes are converted to geocentric
 * latitudes before computing geocentric unit vectors (and vice versa).

 * This class handles interactions with ranking tables in the database. Ranking tables simply contain items that need to
 * be ranked in some way or another and their numerical ranking. For example, say an application needed to know which
 * row to insert into a given table when multiple rows must be chosen from to determine which one to insert. One way to
 * decide that would be to examine the author fields of each row (provided each row has an author field) and pick the
 * row whose author field has a higher priority. To determine which author field has the higher priority, the ranking
 * table would be queried for both authors, and both authors' priorities would be returned. Thus, ranking tables can
 * have very few columns - as few as two: whatever needs to be ranked and its rank. The values in the rank column are
 * expected to be integers.

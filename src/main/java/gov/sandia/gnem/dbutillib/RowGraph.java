/**
 * RowGraph manages a set of connected rows from a database. Mathematically, this set of rows forms a directed graph
 * consisting of a set of vertexes (the rows) and edges (one-way connections between pairs of vertexes). Starting from
 * any row, the user can visit every other row that is connected to the starting row by traversing the edges of this
 * graph. The connections are defined by the schema relationships specified by the user.
 * <p>
 * No two rows in a RowGraph are 'equal'. Row equality is defined in two ways. First, if two rows have the same rowID,
 * they are equal. Second, if two rows come from the same table, and that table has unique keys, and the values of all
 * the unique keys in the two rows are 'equal' (as defined by {@link Column#evaluateEquality(Object, Object)
 * Column.evalateEquality(value1, value2)}), then the two rows are equal.
 * <p>
 * RowGraph implements the Set interface, which allows calling routines to iterate over the Rows in an instance of a
 * RowGraph. Many of the methods defined in the Set interface are overloaded.
 * <p>
 * RowGraph can operate in either of two modes. In the first mode, the RowGraph object goes out to the database and
 * extracts the entire graph of connected rows and stores it in memory, including both the set of vertexes and all the
 * associated connections. Once this relatively time consuming operation has been completed, the user can traverse the
 * graph as many times as desired, accessing the graph in memory, which will be faster then re-executing all the SQL
 * statements. This mode of operation is implemented when RowGraph constructors that include initialRow parameters are
 * invoked, or when calls to the assembleGraph methods ({@link #assembleGraph(Row) assembleGraph(Row)} or
 * {@link #assembleGraph(Collection) assembleGraph(Collection<Row>)}) are made.
 * <p>
 * In the second mode of operation, relatively small batches of rows are extracted from the database and made available
 * to the user one time. SELECT statements against the database are executed as the need arises. Results of select
 * statements are stored in memory only until the extracted rows have been processed, then they are released for garbage
 * collection. This mode of operation is implemented by invoking the RowGraph constructor that takes only a Schema
 * parameter. Rows are retrieved from the database with the getRows() methods ({@link #getRows() getRows()},
 * {@link #getRows(Row) getRows(Row)}, {@link #getRows(Collection) getRows(Collection<Row>)}) or Iterators (
 * {@link #iterator() iterator()}, {@link #iterator(Collection) iterator(Collection<Row>)}, {@link #iterator(Row)
 * iterator(Row)}) that take initialRow parameters.
 * <p>
 * Hybrid sequences may come up: If a graph is assembled into memory starting from row1, and then later an iterator is
 * invoked starting from row2 where row2 is not a member of the graph currently in memory, then rows will be retrieved
 * from the database, as needed, and returned. If any rows are encountered that are in the graph in memory, the
 * subsequent calls to the iterator will get rows from the graph in memory.
 * <p>
 * When a RowGraph is assembled into memory, then a number of useful methods are available for extracting Collections of
 * Rows from the RowGraph. {@link #getRows() getRows()} returns the Set of all the Rows in the graph,
 * {@link #getRowsOfType(String) getRowsOfType(tableType)} returns the Set of all the Rows in the graph that come from a
 * table of a specified type, {@link #getChildren(Row) getChildren(row)} returns the Set of all the direct descendants
 * of the specified Row, {@link #getChildrenOfType(Row, String) getChildrenOfType(row, tableType)} returns the Set of
 * all the descendants of a specified row that come from a table of the specified type, and many more.
 * <p>
 * Using the Iterator methods, RowGraphs are traversed in breadth-first order.
 * <p>
 * The assembleGraph() methods ({@link #assembleGraph(Row) assembleGraph(Row)} or {@link #assembleGraph(Collection)
 * assembleGraph(Collection<Row>)}) will add sub graphs to an existing graph. assembleGraph methods are called
 * automatically by RowGraph constructors that take initialRow parameters. When called with a collection of rows,
 * {@link #assembleGraph(Collection) assembleGraph(Collection<Row>)} assembles one graph that includes all the rows
 * connected to each of the initial rows. It is possible that a graph may have one or more disconnected sub graphs
 * (i.e., it may be impossible to reach any of the rows in one sub graph from any of the rows in any of the other
 * subgraphs). Repeated calls to assembleGraph(), without intervening calls to {@link #clear() clear()}, result in the
 * addition of more rows (without duplication) to the existing graph, not replacement of the existing graph.
 * <p>
 * RowGraphs can be disassembled and later reassembled, which is useful for passing RowGraph objects between
 * applications. See methods {@link #add(Row, Collection, Collection) add(row, children, parents)} and
 * {@link #createLinks() createLinks()} for details.

PCalc is a software tool for extracting information from seismic velocity 
models, including:
    - velocity profiles, transects and grid, 
    - predictions of travel time, uncertainty, and more,
    - ray path geometries.

PCalc is delivered with the following components:

- A license agreement.

- PCalc_Users_Manual.pdf.

- Source code

- A precompiled jar file: target/pcalc-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar. 
  This jar file can be run as a a standalone application or can be used as a 
  library in user-developed java applications.  The jar was compiled with 
  java JDK version 10.

- A pom.xml file which can be used with Maven (https://maven.apache.org) 
  to rebuild the jar file from the source code.

- Run-script pcalc.sh.  User's will likely have to edit some paths defined
  in the run script to point to correct locations on their systems.

Oracle Libraries

PCalc depends on Oracle ojdbc<version>.jar.  This library is not delivered
with PCalc. Users will need to find the required jar file on their system 
and specify its location in the pcalc.sh run-script and/or maven pom.xml file.  
PCalc was tested successfully with ojbdc7 and ojbdc8.  Other versions
may work as well.

RSTT/SLBM

PCalc can compute predictions using RSTT/SLBM but the C++ SLBM libraries must
be downloaded and installed.  To install SLBM, download the source code from
https://www.sandia.gov/rstt/software/downloads. Unzip the download file and 
cd into the unzipped rstt directory.  Type 'make' to build the SLBM 
libraries.  Edit run-script pcalc.sh and specify the path to the rstt
directory.
